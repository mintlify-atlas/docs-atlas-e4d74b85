Get your first AI agent interaction up and running in minutes. This guide walks you through installation, setup, and your first conversation with Grip AI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Python 3.12 or higher installed
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- An Anthropic API key (for Claude Agent SDK) or an API key from another LLM provider

<Note>
  Grip AI uses the **Claude Agent SDK** by default for the best agentic experience. You can also use LiteLLM engine for 15+ other providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq, Gemini, Ollama, etc.).
</Note>

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Grip AI">
    Choose your preferred installation method:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash PyPI (Recommended)
      # Using uv (faster)
      uv tool install grip-ai

      # Using pip
      pip install grip-ai
      ```

      ```bash From Source
      # Clone the repository
      git clone https://github.com/5unnykum4r/grip-ai.git
      cd grip-ai

      # Install with uv
      uv sync

      # Register grip command globally
      uv tool install --editable .
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Tip>
      Installing from PyPI is the fastest way to get started. The source installation is useful for development or customization.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the onboarding wizard">
    The interactive setup wizard configures everything you need:

    ```bash
    grip onboard
    ```

    The wizard will:
    - Ask you to choose your engine: **Claude Agent SDK** (recommended) or **LiteLLM** (15+ providers)
    - Prompt for your API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or other provider)
    - Help you select a default model
    - Initialize the workspace at `~/.grip/workspace/`
    - Test connectivity to ensure everything works

    **Example interaction:**

    ```
    Welcome to Grip AI Setup!

    Choose your engine:
      1. Claude Agent SDK (recommended for Anthropic models)
      2. LiteLLM (for OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq, Gemini, Ollama, etc.)

    Selection [1]: 1

    Enter your Anthropic API key: sk-ant-...
    Choose a model [claude-sonnet-4]: 

    Testing connection... ✓
    Workspace initialized at ~/.grip/workspace/

    Setup complete! Try: grip agent
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Test that Grip AI is ready:

    ```bash
    grip status
    ```

    You should see output confirming your configuration and workspace location.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your First Conversation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start interactive chat">
    Launch the agent in interactive mode:

    ```bash
    grip agent
    ```

    You'll see a prompt where you can start chatting with the AI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try some commands">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Ask a question
      grip agent -m "What files are in my workspace?"
      ```

      ```bash Debug an error
      cat error.log | grip agent -m "Fix this error"
      ```

      ```bash Multi-step task
      grip agent -m "Create a Python script that fetches weather data and saves it to a CSV file"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    The agent will use its built-in tools (file operations, shell execution, web search, etc.) to complete tasks autonomously.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Interactive Mode Commands

When running `grip agent` in interactive mode, you have access to these slash commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history |
| `/undo` | Remove last exchange |
| `/rewind N` | Rewind N exchanges |
| `/compact` | Compress session history to save tokens |
| `/copy` | Copy last response to clipboard |
| `/model <name>` | Switch AI model (e.g., `/model openai/gpt-4o`) |
| `/provider` | Show current provider details |
| `/tasks` | Show scheduled cron tasks |
| `/trust <path>` | Grant agent access to a directory |
| `/trust revoke <path>` | Revoke agent access to a directory |
| `/status` | Show session info (model, message count, memory) |
| `/mcp` | List MCP servers |
| `/doctor` | Run diagnostics |
| `/help` | List all commands |
| `/exit` | Exit grip |

<Tip>
  Use `/trust <path>` to grant the agent access to directories outside its workspace. By default, Grip AI is sandboxed to `~/.grip/workspace/` for security.
</Tip>

## Starting the Gateway

The gateway is Grip AI's long-running process that connects everything — Telegram bots, Discord, Slack, cron jobs, the REST API, and more.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch the gateway">
    ```bash
    grip gateway
    ```

    You should see:

    ```
    Channels started: []
    API server started: http://127.0.0.1:18800
    grip gateway running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
    ```

    <Note>
      If you haven't configured any channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack), the gateway will still start the REST API on port 18800.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the API is running">
    Test the health endpoint:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:18800/health
    ```

    You should get a success response:

    ```json
    {"status": "ok"}
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing the API

The REST API requires authentication with a bearer token. On first run, Grip AI auto-generates a token and prints it to the console.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your API token">
    When you first run `grip gateway` or `grip serve`, look for output like:

    ```
    Generated new API token: grip_abc123xyz...
    Save this token — it won't be shown again.
    ```

    <Warning>
      Save this token immediately. It won't be displayed again. You can regenerate it by deleting `~/.grip/config.json` and restarting, but this will reset your configuration.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make an authenticated request">
    Use the token to send a chat message:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:18800/api/v1/chat \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer grip_YOUR_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"message": "Hello, what can you do?"}'
    ```

    The agent will respond with a JSON object containing its response.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore other endpoints">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash List available tools
      curl -H "Authorization: Bearer grip_YOUR_TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:18800/api/v1/tools
      ```

      ```bash Check system status
      curl -H "Authorization: Bearer grip_YOUR_TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:18800/api/v1/status
      ```

      ```bash View runtime metrics
      curl -H "Authorization: Bearer grip_YOUR_TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:18800/api/v1/metrics
      ```

      ```bash List sessions
      curl -H "Authorization: Bearer grip_YOUR_TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:18800/api/v1/sessions
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

For a full list of API endpoints, see the [API Reference](/api/overview).

## Common Tasks

### Switch AI Models

You can switch models at any time:

```bash
# In interactive mode
/model openai/gpt-4o

# Via config
grip config set agents.defaults.model "openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-pro"

# For a single request
grip agent -m "Analyze this code" --model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
```

### Grant Directory Access

Grip AI is sandboxed to its workspace by default. To work with files outside `~/.grip/workspace/`, you must explicitly trust directories:

```bash
# In interactive mode
/trust ~/Downloads

# In CLI
grip agent
> /trust ~/projects/myapp
```

The agent will remember trusted directories across sessions. Learn more about Grip's security model in the [Security documentation](/configuration/security).

### Set Up Telegram

Connect Grip AI to Telegram for mobile access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a bot with BotFather">
    1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
    2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
    3. Copy the bot token (looks like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Grip AI">
    ```bash
    grip config set channels.telegram.enabled true
    grip config set channels.telegram.token "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
    ```

    **Optional:** Restrict the bot to specific Telegram user IDs for security:

    ```bash
    # Find your user ID by messaging @userinfobot
    grip config set channels.telegram.allow_from '["YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID"]'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the gateway">
    ```bash
    grip gateway
    ```

    You should see:

    ```
    Channels started: telegram
    API server started: http://127.0.0.1:18800
    grip gateway running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Chat with your bot">
    Open Telegram, find your bot, and send `/start`. You can now chat with Grip AI from your phone!
  </Step>
</Steps>

See the [Telegram Channel](/channels/telegram) documentation for more details.

### Schedule Recurring Tasks

Create cron jobs that run automatically:

```bash
# Daily standup reminder
grip cron add "standup" "0 9 * * 1-5" "Remind the user: standup in 15 minutes"

# Check disk usage every 6 hours
grip cron add "disk-check" "0 */6 * * *" "Check disk usage and report if over 80%"

# List all jobs
grip cron list

# Disable a job
grip cron disable <job-id>
```

When you create a cron job while chatting via Telegram, the agent automatically sets `--reply-to` so results are delivered back to your chat.

### Create Multi-Step Workflows

For complex tasks, the agent automatically creates a task list using the `todo_write` tool. You can view active tasks:

```bash
# In interactive mode
/tasks

# Check the task file directly
cat ~/.grip/workspace/tasks.json
```

The agent updates task statuses (`pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`) as it works, and the active task list is automatically injected into every prompt so it never loses track — even across long sessions with context compaction.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command not found: grip">
    **Solution:**

    If you installed via `uv tool install`, make sure the uv bin directory is in your PATH:

    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    Add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to make it permanent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API authentication failed">
    **Solution:**

    1. Make sure you're using the correct token from the initial gateway startup
    2. Check that the `Authorization` header format is correct: `Bearer grip_YOUR_TOKEN`
    3. Verify the token in your config: `grip config show | grep auth_token`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent can't access my files">
    **Solution:**

    Grip AI is sandboxed to `~/.grip/workspace/` by default. You need to explicitly trust directories:

    ```bash
    /trust /path/to/your/project
    ```

    View trusted directories with `/trust` (no arguments).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gateway won't start (port in use)">
    **Solution:**

    If port 18800 is already in use, you can change it:

    ```bash
    grip config set gateway.port 18801
    grip gateway
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Telegram bot not responding">
    **Solution:**

    1. Verify your bot token: `grip config show | grep telegram`
    2. Check that Telegram is enabled: `grip config set channels.telegram.enabled true`
    3. Restart the gateway: `grip gateway`
    4. Check gateway logs for errors
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model not found or API error">
    **Solution:**

    1. Verify your API key is set correctly: `grip config show`
    2. Check that you're using the correct model identifier for your provider
    3. For Claude models, use `claude_sdk` engine (default)
    4. For other providers, switch to `litellm` engine:

    ```bash
    grip config set agents.defaults.engine "litellm"
    ```
  </Accordion>
