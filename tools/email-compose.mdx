**Filename format:**
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_sanitized_subject.md
```

**Example:**
```
20260228_143022_Contract_Review_Request.md
```

**Subject sanitization:**
- Alphanumeric characters, spaces, hyphens, and underscores allowed
- Maximum 50 characters
- Spaces replaced with underscores

---

## Return Value

```
Draft saved to drafts/20260228_143022_Research_Collaboration_Proposal.md

---

**Subject:** Research Collaboration Proposal

Dear Dr. Smith,

I am writing to propose a collaboration on the climate modeling project.

Sincerely,
Alice Johnson

## Use Cases

1. **Professional outreach:** Compose formal business emails
2. **Team communication:** Draft friendly updates for colleagues
3. **Incident response:** Create urgent notifications for critical issues
4. **Customer relations:** Write apologetic emails for service issues
5. **Follow-up reminders:** Send polite follow-ups on pending items

---

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the right tone** for your audience and purpose
2. **Provide context** for followup and apologetic emails
3. **Keep body concise** — one or two paragraphs ideal
4. **Review drafts** before sending (tool does NOT send)
5. **Use urgent sparingly** to maintain its effectiveness

---

## Important Notes

**This tool does NOT send emails.** It only creates drafts saved to `workspace/drafts/`. You must copy the content to your email client to send.

**No email service integration:** The tool does not connect to SMTP servers, Gmail API, or any email service.

## Implementation

Defined in `grip/tools/email_compose.py` at email_compose.py:82. Uses:
- Predefined tone templates with greeting/closing patterns
- Variable substitution for recipient and sender names
- Context insertion for followup and apologetic tones
- Markdown format for easy copy-paste into email clients
- Automatic draft directory creation (`workspace/drafts/`)
- UTC timestamps for consistent filename sorting
