description: Extend agents with specialized knowledge through 15 built-in markdown skills and workspace-level overrides
---

## Overview

Skills are markdown files that provide agents with specialized knowledge, workflows, and domain expertise. Grip AI ships with 15 built-in skills covering common development patterns, and supports workspace-specific overrides for project customization.

## Architecture

The skills system follows a three-tier loading hierarchy:

```python
# From grip/skills/loader.py:15-19
# Skills are discovered from (in priority order — later sources override earlier):
#   1. grip/skills/builtin/   — built-in skills shipped with grip
#   2. ~/.agents/skills/      — global shared skills used by multiple agentic tools
#   3. workspace/skills/      — user-installed skills specific to this workspace
```

<Note>
Later sources override earlier ones. A skill named "code-review" in `workspace/skills/` will replace the built-in `code-review` skill.
</Note>

## Skill File Format

Skills use markdown with optional YAML frontmatter:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown YAML Frontmatter (Preferred)
---
title: GitHub Expert
description: Specialized knowledge for GitHub API and workflows
category: automation
always_loaded: false
---

## Overview

This skill provides expertise in GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs...

## Workflows

### Creating Pull Requests

1. Check current branch
2. Push commits to remote
3. Use `gh pr create` command
...
```

```markdown Legacy Format (H1 + Blockquote)
# GitHub Expert

> Specialized knowledge for GitHub API and workflows

<!-- always_loaded -->

## Overview

This skill provides expertise in GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs...
```
</CodeGroup>

## File Discovery

The loader supports two file structures:

1. **Folder-based** (preferred): `skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
2. **Flat files**: `skills/skill-name.md`

```python
# From grip/skills/loader.py:85-98
def _scan_directory(self, directory: Path) -> None:
    """Scan a directory for skills in both flat and folder-based formats."""
    # Folder-based: skill-name/SKILL.md
    for path in sorted(directory.glob("*/SKILL.md")):
        skill = self._parse_skill_file(path)
        if skill:
            self._skills[skill.name] = skill
    
    # Flat files: *.md (directly in the directory, not in subfolders)
    for path in sorted(directory.glob("*.md")):
        if path.is_file():
            skill = self._parse_skill_file(path)
            if skill:
                self._skills[skill.name] = skill
```

## Skill Loading

```python
# From grip/skills/loader.py:56-83
def scan(self) -> list[Skill]:
    """Scan all skill directories and load skill metadata.
    
    Supports two formats:
      - Flat files: skills_dir/*.md
      - Folder-based: skills_dir/skill-name/SKILL.md (preferred)
    
    Scan order (later overrides earlier):
      1. grip/skills/builtin/   — shipped with grip
      2. ~/.agents/skills/      — global shared skills across agentic tools
      3. workspace/skills/      — workspace-specific user overrides
    """
    self._skills.clear()
    
    # Built-in skills first (lowest priority)
    if self._builtin_skills_dir.exists():
        self._scan_directory(self._builtin_skills_dir)
    
    # Global shared skills (override built-ins)
    if self._GLOBAL_SKILLS_DIR.exists():
        self._scan_directory(self._GLOBAL_SKILLS_DIR)
    
    # Workspace skills (highest priority — override everything)
    if self._workspace_skills_dir.exists():
        self._scan_directory(self._workspace_skills_dir)
    
    logger.debug("Loaded {} skills", len(self._skills))
    return list(self._skills.values())
```

## Installing Skills

### CLI

```bash
# List available skills
grip skills list

# View skill details
grip skills show code-review

# Install from URL
grip skills install https://example.com/my-skill.md

# Install from file
grip skills install ./custom-skill.md

# Create new skill
grip skills create my-skill --category automation

# Remove skill
grip skills remove my-skill
```

### Programmatic

```python
# From grip/skills/loader.py:120-133
def install_skill(self, content: str, filename: str) -> Path:
    """Save a skill file to the workspace skills directory.
    
    Returns the path of the created file.
    """
    self._workspace_skills_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    if not filename.endswith(".md"):
        filename = f"{filename}.md"
    if "/" in filename or "\\" in filename or ".." in filename:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid skill filename: {filename!r}")
    target = self._workspace_skills_dir / filename
    target.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")
    logger.info("Skill installed: {}", target)
    return target
```

## Always-Loaded Skills

Skills can be marked as `always_loaded` to automatically inject them into every agent session:

```python
# From grip/skills/loader.py:112-118
def get_always_loaded_content(self) -> str:
    """Return concatenated content of skills marked always_loaded."""
    parts = []
    for skill in self._skills.values():
        if skill.always_loaded:
            parts.append(f"## Skill: {skill.name}\n\n{skill.content}")
    return "\n\n---\n\n".join(parts)
```

**Use cases for always-loaded skills:**
- Project-specific coding standards
- Company style guides
- Security policies
- Common troubleshooting steps

<Note>
Be cautious with always-loaded skills — they consume token budget on every request.
</Note>

## Skill Data Structure

```python
# From grip/skills/loader.py:29-42
@dataclass(slots=True)
class Skill:
    """A loaded skill with parsed metadata."""
    name: str              # Unique identifier
    description: str       # One-line summary
    content: str          # Full markdown content
    source_path: Path     # File location
    always_loaded: bool = False  # Auto-inject into system prompt
    category: str = "general"    # Organizational tag
    
    @property
    def display_name(self) -> str:
        return self.name or self.source_path.stem
```

## Parsing Logic

The loader handles both frontmatter and legacy formats:

```python
# From grip/skills/loader.py:180-229
@staticmethod
def _parse_skill_file(path: Path) -> Skill | None:
    """Parse a SKILL.md file into a Skill object.
    
    Supports two formats:
      1. YAML frontmatter (preferred):
         ---
         title: Skill Name
         description: What it does
         category: automation
         always_loaded: true
         ---
         (content below)
    
      2. Legacy H1 + blockquote (backward compatible):
         # Skill Name
         > Description.
         <!-- always_loaded -->
         ... rest is content
    """
    try:
        text = path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    except OSError as exc:
        logger.warning("Cannot read skill file {}: {}", path, exc)
        return None
    
    lines = text.strip().splitlines()
    if not lines:
        return None
    
    # Default name from directory or filename
    name = path.stem
    if path.name == "SKILL.md":
        name = path.parent.name
    
    # Try YAML frontmatter first
    frontmatter, remaining = SkillsLoader._parse_frontmatter(text)
    if frontmatter:
        fm_name = frontmatter.get("title") or frontmatter.get("name") or name
        fm_desc = frontmatter.get("description", "")
        fm_category = frontmatter.get("category", "general")
        fm_always = frontmatter.get("always_loaded", "false").lower() in ("true", "yes", "1")
        return Skill(
            name=fm_name,
            description=fm_desc,
            content=remaining.strip(),
            source_path=path,
            always_loaded=fm_always,
            category=fm_category,
        )
    
    # Fallback: legacy H1 + blockquote parsing
    # ... (omitted for brevity)
```

## Workspace Overrides

To customize a built-in skill:

1. Copy the skill to `workspace/skills/`:
   ```bash
   cp ~/.grip/skills/builtin/code-review/SKILL.md workspace/skills/code-review.md
   ```

2. Edit the workspace copy:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Code Review
   description: Custom review standards for this project
   category: quality
   always_loaded: true
   ---
   
   ## Project-Specific Standards
   
   - All PRs must include tests
   - Maximum function length: 50 lines
   - Use TypeScript strict mode
   ...
   ```

3. The workspace skill now overrides the built-in version

## Integration with Agents

Skills are injected into the system prompt via the ContextBuilder:

```python
# From grip/agent/context.py (conceptual)
def build_system_prompt(self) -> str:
    parts = []
    
    # Base instructions
    parts.append(self._config.agents.system_prompt)
    
    # Always-loaded skills
    always_loaded = self._skills_loader.get_always_loaded_content()
    if always_loaded:
        parts.append(always_loaded)
    
    # Tool documentation
    parts.append(self._build_tools_section())
    
    # Active tasks
    parts.append(self._build_todos_section())
    
    # Metadata
    parts.append(self._build_metadata_section())
    
    return "\n\n".join(parts)
```

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Skill Design">
- **Keep skills focused**: One domain per skill
- **Use clear headings**: Structure with H2/H3 for easy scanning
- **Provide examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Set categories**: Group related skills for discovery
- **Write concise descriptions**: One sentence summaries
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Content Guidelines">
- **Start with overview**: Explain what the skill provides
- **Include workflows**: Step-by-step procedures
- **Add code snippets**: Concrete examples help
- **Reference related skills**: Build a knowledge graph
- **Keep it current**: Update as tools/practices evolve
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Considerations">
- **Minimize always-loaded**: Each adds to every request
- **Trim verbose content**: Focus on actionable information
- **Use workspace skills**: Override only what you need
- **Archive unused skills**: Move to `~/.agents/skills/archive/`
</Accordion>

## Creating Custom Skills

Use the skill-creator skill as a template:

```markdown
---
title: API Integration Expert
description: Best practices for integrating third-party APIs
category: integration
always_loaded: false
---

## Overview

This skill provides guidance on integrating external APIs with proper
error handling, rate limiting, and caching strategies.

## Core Principles

1. **Always handle errors gracefully**: Wrap API calls in try-catch
2. **Respect rate limits**: Implement exponential backoff
3. **Cache aggressively**: Reduce API calls where possible
4. **Log everything**: Track requests for debugging

## Common Patterns

### Retry Logic

```python
import backoff

@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, requests.RequestException, max_tries=5)
def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

### Rate Limiting

```python
from ratelimit import limits, sleep_and_retry

@sleep_and_retry
@limits(calls=100, period=60)
def api_call():
    return requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
```
